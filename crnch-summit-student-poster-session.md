# CRNCH Summit Poster Session
The CRNCH Student Poster Session will be held on Feburary 3rd, 2022 from ~4:30-6 PM. We are excited to have a large number of posters from our CRNCH students, and we also are thrilled to be able to feature the work of some of our [CRNCH PhD Fellowship winners](https://crnch.gatech.edu/content/crnch-fellowship).

We note that in some cases, we have not linked posters due to work being under submission.

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) estimates agentsâ€™ trajectories and constructs maps, and localization is a fundamental kernel in autonomous machines at all computing scales, from drones, AR/VR to self-driving cars. In this work, we present an energy-efficient and runtime-reconfigurable FPGA-based accelerator for robotic localization. We exploit SLAM-specific data locality, sparsity, reuse, and parallelism, and achieve 5x performance improvement over state-of-the-art. Especially, our design is reconfigurable at runtime according to the environment to save power while sustaining accuracy and performance.
