# CRNCH Summit Poster Session
The CRNCH Student Poster Session will be held on Feburary 3rd, 2022 from ~4:30-6 PM. We are excited to have a large number of posters from our CRNCH students, and we also are thrilled to be able to feature the work of some of our [CRNCH PhD Fellowship winners](https://crnch.gatech.edu/content/crnch-fellowship).

We note that in some cases, we have not linked posters due to work being under submission.

Plasmonic metal-insulator-metal waveguide (MIM WG) is a promising building
block of devices of a plasmonic computing system, and metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM)
WG offers high-speed detection of plasmon signals. MIM and MSM WG couplers are an
essential component of any integrated computing system that requires an interface between the
plasmonic devices and the electronic circuits. However, the MIM and MSM WG couplers have
not yet been explored and systematically studied. This work analyzes and benchmarks various
coupling schemes of the plasmonic MIM and MSM WGs to single out the best coupling approach.
From the detailed numerical analysis and considering the trade-offs among coupling loss, total
capacitance, system noise, and bandwidth, a holistic metric is introduced to quantify and compare
the system-level performance of the couplers, and a novel coupling scheme is identified as the
most attractive choice for coupling the two WGs.

This study implements the Quantum Verification of Matrix Products (QVMP) using the Qiskit framework. We evaluate this implementation using gate count, qubit count, circuit depth, and transpilation time metrics. We also analyze the oracle authoring capabilities of Qiskit.

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) estimates agentsâ€™ trajectories and constructs maps, and localization is a fundamental kernel in autonomous machines at all computing scales, from drones, AR/VR to self-driving cars. In this work, we present an energy-efficient and runtime-reconfigurable FPGA-based accelerator for robotic localization. We exploit SLAM-specific data locality, sparsity, reuse, and parallelism, and achieve 5x performance improvement over state-of-the-art. Especially, our design is reconfigurable at runtime according to the environment to save power while sustaining accuracy and performance.
