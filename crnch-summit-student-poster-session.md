Plasmonic metal-insulator-metal waveguide (MIM WG) is a promising building
block of devices of a plasmonic computing system, and metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM)
WG offers high-speed detection of plasmon signals. MIM and MSM WG couplers are an
essential component of any integrated computing system that requires an interface between the
plasmonic devices and the electronic circuits. However, the MIM and MSM WG couplers have
not yet been explored and systematically studied. This work analyzes and benchmarks various
coupling schemes of the plasmonic MIM and MSM WGs to single out the best coupling approach.
From the detailed numerical analysis and considering the trade-offs among coupling loss, total
capacitance, system noise, and bandwidth, a holistic metric is introduced to quantify and compare
the system-level performance of the couplers, and a novel coupling scheme is identified as the
most attractive choice for coupling the two WGs.

<a id="sakm">**Stefan Abi-Karam, Rishov Sarkar - "Graph Neural Network Accelerators for FPGAs: GenGNN and Future Research Directions"**</a>

In this work, we present a generic GNN acceleration framework using High-Level Synthesis (HLS), named GenGNN, with two-fold goals. First, we aim to deliver ultra-fast GNN inference without any graph preprocessing for real-time requirements. Second, we aim to support a diverse set of GNN models with the extensibility to flexibly adapt to new models. We verify our implementation on-board on CRNCH’s Xilinx Alveo U50 FPGAs and observe a speed-up of up to 25× against CPU baseline and 13× against GPU baseline. We also propose two expansions for this work. The first is to improve upon GenGNN across both small graphs and large graphs. We are targeting ultra-fast small graph acceleration to enable high throughput for thousands of small graphs, as well as scalable large graph acceleration to optimize latency for graphs with millions of nodes and edges. The second is to automate model conversion from PyTorch GNN models to HLS C++ code. Our GNN accelerators lack similar optimizations and repetition of the same kernels across all models. To address this, we want to build an HLS library of GNN components allowing for automatic templating and generation to HLS given a PyTorch model.

<a id="aa">**Austin Adams, Elton Pinto - "Enabling a Programming Environment for an Experimental Ion Trap Quantum Testbed"**</a>

Ion trap quantum hardware promises to provide a computational advantage over classical computing for specific problem spaces while also providing an alternative hardware implementation path to cryogenic quantum systems as typified by IBM's quantum hardware. However, programming ion trap systems currently requires both strategies to mitigate high levels of noise and also tools to ease the challenge of programming these systems with pulse- or gate-level operations.

This work focuses on improving the state-of-the-art for quantum programming of ion trap testbeds through the use of a quantum language specification, QCOR, and by demonstrating multi-level optimizations at the language, intermediate representation, and hardware backend levels. We implement a new QCOR/XACC backend to target a general ion trap testbed and then demonstrate the usage of multi-level optimizations to improve circuit fidelity and to reduce gate count. These techniques include the usage of a backend-specific numerical optimizer and physical gate optimizations to minimize the number of native instructions sent to the hardware. We evaluate our compiler backend using several QCOR benchmark programs, finding that on present testbed hardware, our compiler backend maintains the number of two-qubit native operations but decreases the number of single-qubit native operations by 1.52 times compared to the previous compiler regime. For projected testbed hardware upgrades, our compiler sees a reduction in two-qubit native operations by 2.40 times and one-qubit native operations by 6.13 times.

<a id="sb">**Spencer Bowles, Mourad Musallam - "Using LASSO to Optimize SNN Decoders on Mixed-Signal Harware"</a>

The operation of efficient methods of computation is imperative to reduce the energy consumption of computation. SNNs, LASSO, and mixed-signal architectures all provide methods to decrease the power consumption of running neural networks. A Nengo model can be constructed to deploy to several architectures. Compression and flattening of input SHD are required to meet memory requirements. On the SDH dataset, the model has RMSEs between 0.012 and 0.014. Unfortunately, neither novel architecture could be tested for power efficiency. For the FPAA, issues with the Reconfigurable Analog Signal Processor (RASP) toolchain prevented development of a hardware description designed for the FPAA.  For Braindrop, the server hosting the architecture went offline before development of the Nengo model could be finished.

<a id="ge">**Gibran Essa - "A Library for Automated Adiabatic Circuit Generation"</a>

This poster presents an introduction to the concepts behind adiabatic computing and adiabatic circuits. Landauer's principle and the idea that loss of information causes energy dissipation in a circuit. This presents a lower limit to energy disspiation in a circuit. By using adiabatic computing, we can prevent this data loss and therefore power loss. There are various methods of implementing adiabatic computing, and we plan to leverage these to create a standart cell library for use in automatically generating very large adiabatic circuits.

<a id="pg">**Pulkit Gupta, Jack Lafiandra - "Shallow Online Neural Branch Prediction"</a>

The Shallow Online Neural (SON) predictor makes use of a shallow neural network that is trained in an online fashion to predict branch outcomes. By utilizing a network with a hidden layer and a few activation functions, the predictor is able to extract features for branch prediction using the global and local histories. The predictor also takes advantage of a small tournament to decide between the neural prediction and another predictor. The SON predictor is able to extract branch relationships that cannot be discovered by TAGE or the Hashed Perceptron Predictor. While not as performant as the BranchNet Predictor, the SON predictor is physically realizable and nears the performance. This work also explores key architectural changes that can be applied to hardware implementations through the use of quantized fixed point values in place of floating point values while maintaining reasonable accuracy. In certain workloads, the SON predictor outperforms the state of the art and it is shown that with improvements to the tournament mechanism, the SON predictor has a much higher theoretical prediction accuracy than state of the art.

<a id="ep">**Elton Pinto - "Implementing Quantum Verification of Matrix Products"**</a>

This study implements the Quantum Verification of Matrix Products (QVMP) using the Qiskit framework. We evaluate this implementation using gate count, qubit count, circuit depth, and transpilation time metrics. We also analyze the oracle authoring capabilities of Qiskit.

<a id="vh">**Vincent Huang - "Accurately Modeling Sparse Accesses for Benchmarking and Architectural Simulation"**</a>

We typically generate large memory traces to try and replicate useful memory behaviors from applications. With our current workflow, we might use a tool like DynamoRio or Pin to generate memory traces and then feed those into a simulator. In our desired workflow, we would like to parse memory traces in an online fashion to generate representative sparse access patterns. These patterns can then be used as inputs to architectural simulators (via tools like SST's Miranda trace generator) or sparse access benchmark suites like our Spatter benchmark.This tool attempts to provide the means to parse applications in a reasonable amount of time and then provide reusable patterns that can be used to investigate and validate performance for a specific computer architecture.

<a id="zw">**Zishen Wan - "An Energy-Efficient and Runtime-Reconfigurable FPGA-Based Accelerator for Robotic Localization Systems"**</a>

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) estimates agents’ trajectories and constructs maps, and localization is a fundamental kernel in autonomous machines at all computing scales, from drones, AR/VR to self-driving cars. In this work, we present an energy-efficient and runtime-reconfigurable FPGA-based accelerator for robotic localization. We exploit SLAM-specific data locality, sparsity, reuse, and parallelism, and achieve 5x performance improvement over state-of-the-art. Especially, our design is reconfigurable at runtime according to the environment to save power while sustaining accuracy and performance.
