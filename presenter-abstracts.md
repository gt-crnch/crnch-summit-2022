## Kunle Olukoton - _The Future of AI Systems - Let the Data Flow!_

<a id="ko_abstract">### Abstract ###</a> 
As the benefits from Moore’s Law diminish, future computing performance improvements must
rely on specialized accelerators for applications in high performance computing, artificial
intelligence, and traditional data processing. These challenging applications are characterized
by terabyte sized models, data sparsity and irregular control flow. In this talk, we explain how
Reconfigurable Dataflow Accelerators (RDAs) can be used to accelerate a broad set of dataintensive
applications with these characteristics. SambaNova Systems is using RDA technology
contained in Reconfigurable Dataflow Units (RDUs) to achieve record‐setting performance on
challenging machine learning tasks. We will describe how RDAs can also be used to accelerate
database and HPC applications with irregular control and data flow using a new execution
model called Dataflow threads.


<a id="ko_bio">### Biography ###</a> 
Kunle Olukotun is the Cadence Design Professor of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science at Stanford University. Olukotun is a pioneer in multi-core processor
design and the leader of the Stanford Hydra chip multiprocessor (CMP) research
project.

In 2017 Olukotun co-founded SambaNova Systems, a Machine Learning and Artificial
Intelligence company, and continues to lead as their Chief Technologist. Prior to
SambaNova Systems, Olukotun founded Afara Websystems to develop highthroughput,
low-power multi-core processors for server systems. The Afara multi-core
processor, called Niagara, was acquired by Sun Microsystems and now powers
Oracle’s SPARC-based servers.

Olukotun is the Director of the Pervasive Parallel Lab and a member of the Data
Analytics for What’s Next (DAWN) Lab, developing infrastructure for usable machine
learning.

Olukotun is an ACM Fellow and IEEE Fellow for contributions to multiprocessors on a chip
and multi-threaded processor design. Olukotun recently won the IEEE Computer
Society’s Harry H. Goode Memorial Award and was also elected to the National
Academy of Engineering. Kunle received his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from The University of Michigan.
